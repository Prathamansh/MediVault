IMPORTANT: To test the OCR features, you need to add a medical document image file here.

1. Rename your image file to "sample_prescription.jpg" 
2. Place it in this directory (Hackathon/backend/static/test_docs/)
3. The image should contain text that can be extracted via OCR
4. For best results, use a clear, well-lit photo of a medical document

Example content could be:
- A prescription
- A lab report
- A medical certificate

The test functionality will look for a file specifically named "sample_prescription.jpg" in this directory.
